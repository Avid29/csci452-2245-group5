/*
** All user main() functions have the following prototype:
**
**	int name( int argc, char *argv[] );
**
** To simplify declaring them, we define a macro that expands into
** that header. This can be used both in the implementation (followed
** by the function body) and in places where we just need the prototype
** (following it with a semicolon).
**
** Each is designed to test some facility of the OS; see the users.h
** header file for a summary of which system calls are tested by
** each user function.
**
** Output from user processes is usually alphabetic.  Uppercase
** characters are "expected" output; lowercase are (typically) "erroneous"
** output.
**
** More specific information about each user process can be found in
** the header comment for that function in its source file.
**
** To make a specific user process available for spawning, uncomment its
** SPAWN_x definition in the list at the end of this header file.
