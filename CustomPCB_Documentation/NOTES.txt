This custom PCB was designed for my System Programming (csci452) course:
 - It was designed using an open source PCB design software called KiCad
   - Total schematic design time ~6 hrs
   - Total layout design time ~12+ hrs
   - The final PCB has four layers
     - Top and bottom layers contain signals
     - Inner layer 1 is a 3.3v copper pour
     - Inner layer 2 is a GND copper pour
 - It was manufactured by a company called JLCPCB
   - I paid $1.80 (+$18 shipping) and received 5x unpopulated boards
 - All components were purchased through DigiKey (parts distributer)
 - The surface mount soldering was performed in the RIT Surface Mount Assembly Lab (Slaughter Hall)
   - Dr. Martin K. Anselm (mkamet@rit.edu) managed the lab
   - A student lab assistant named Isaac Becker (igb3739@rit.edu) showed me how to use the equipment
     - He also took care of soldering many of the smaller parts that I couldn't manage
   - We used a reflow oven to solder all components except for the LEDs (too fragile) and the PS2 connector
     - LEDs were layer soldered with a heat gun, PS2 connector was soldered with a regular soldering iron

The PCB worked without any issues or reworks.

This project was so much fun. I can't wait to design a new PCB someday,
